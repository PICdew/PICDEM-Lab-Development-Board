I had assumed the Vss bus underneath the solderless
prototyping area would be connected to Vss (ground).

Apparently this isn't the case. It appears to be floating
(coincidently at around 3.5V or so).

The jumper between the PIC16F690's Vss and the Vss bus
is required for the LEDs to light up (see the picture).
