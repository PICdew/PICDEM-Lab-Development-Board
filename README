README file for "PICDEM Lab Development Board" git repository.

This is a repository I setup to keep track of my progress while
working through the exercises of the PICDEM Lab Development
Board.

I bought myself the PICDEM Lab Development Board (DM163035)
from Microchip in order to teach myself:
  - the PIC microprocessor (although I am an accomplished embedded
    Linux developer and quite skilled in C programming, I wanted to
    learn the PIC, preferably in assembly as well as learning how
    to wire up my own processors and circuits)
  - electronics/circuits
  - using git under Windows(R)
  - exploring MPLABx


The PICDEM Lab comes with the following processors:
  - PIC10F206
  - PIC12F615
  - PIC16F88
  - PIC16F616
  - PIC16F690

My goals are (in no particular order):
  - to work through the labs as described in the "PICDEM Lab Development
    Board User's Guide" using MPLAB on Windows in C
  - to explore the chips in assembly by reading the relevant data sheets
  - to wire up my own circuits
  - to investigate working with MPLABx under Linux

Since the code and behaviour of the various tools are related to their
versions I'll include the versions of the tools I am using (so in case
this code doesn't work for you, a version mismatch might be the problem).
The versions of the various tools I am using are:
  - WinXP:
    - MPLAB IDE 8.70
    - Hi-Tech C Compiler for the PIC10/12/16 MCU family v9.81
